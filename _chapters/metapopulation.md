## Metapopulation models

*Author*: Simon Frost @sdwfrost

*Date*: 2018-10-19

Metapopulation models partition the population into (typically many) sub-populations (groups, patches,...), including spatially segregated large sub-populations, small households, or even hosts modelled as populations of pathogens ([Ball et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2014.08.001)).
