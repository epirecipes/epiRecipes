    "This code combines two deterministic metapopulation SEIR models as described in [Lloyd & Jansen (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2003.09.003).\n",

    "### Cross-coupling between patches - Equations (8-10)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-coupling is controlled through matrix $\\beta$, describing the effective contact rates acting within and between patches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting the off-diagonal elements of $\\beta$ to zero, we switch off cross-coupling across patches.\n",

    "### Migration between patches - Equations (11-13)\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix $C$ must be such that the elements on the diagonal, denoting outflow of each patch, are negative. Element $c_{ij}$ describes the flow from patch $i$ to patch $j$. For each row, the sum all elements on the row is 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "This model consists of many SEIR models connected through between-patch contact and/or migration of individuals between patches. The model has a constant total population size, which means that births and deaths correspond at each time step.\n",
