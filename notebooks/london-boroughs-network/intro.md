This section implements a stochastic SIR model on a network describing the City of London and Camden. We demonstrate how to work with spatial data files and use the resulting shape files of the burrows of London to generate a potential transmission network. We then simulate a stochastic SIR epidemic model on the resulting network and create an animation of the result.
