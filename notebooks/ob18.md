## Examples from Bjornstad (2018)

This section includes code from Ottar Bjornstad's book on epidemic modeling. The original code is published under a CC-BY-NC license, and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/objornstad/epimdr). The original code has been put into a Jupyter notebook and lightly edited. Ports into other languages follow closely, but are not intended to reproduce the exact figures from the book. As with other textbook examples, accompanying documentation is kept light to keep within fair use policy, hence these examples are best used in conjunction with the original text.
