    "The S-language which is the foundation of R was constructed using an ‘object’-based logic where each object is assigned a ‘class’. The class, in turn, controls printing, plotting and summarizing each object. There are many excellent introductions to S programming , in this chapter we will use S3-class programming to streamline our analysis of epidemics on networks. The basic idea is this: if we label the result of some calculation as class `foo`, then R will look for functions `print.foo()`, `summary.foo()` and `plot.foo()` in the search-path when further interacting with the result of the calculation. Let’s illustarte with a silly example:"

    "Transmission on social networks bears conceptual similarities to spatial transmission. The only difference being that in spatial models transmission occurs among neighbors in space, and transmission on networks occurs among neighbors in social space. We can thus use the type of compact code we used for CML models (section \\[sec:c8cml\\]) to simulate epidemics on networks. A key determinant of invasibility and speed of spread is the average and variance in the number of contacts on the networks . As we saw in the network of spread of gonorrhea (section \\[sec:contra\\]), there is often substantial variation in the number of sexual partners. Section \\[sec:waifw\\] further highlighted age-specific variation in contact rates. It is easiest to consider static networks (networks for which contact patterns do not change over time) for which the contact distribution is characterized by the ‘degree distribution’, contacts are mapped onto ‘edges’ and individuals are ‘nodes’.\n",

    "In the previous spatial coupled map lattice models, transmission was restricted to the eight nearest neighbors on the lattice, so we can think of this as an example of a network with fixed degree of 8. In network theory, an analogous fixed-degree network is constructed as a ring lattice. The associated matrix that flags neighbors is a particular type of [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toeplitz_matrix). We can define a `ringlattice`-function to generate such networks with `N` nodes and `2*K` degrees. We label the result to be of class `cm` (short for contact matrix):"
