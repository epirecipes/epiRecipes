    "In addition to the mouse malaria data discussed in sections \\[sec:c6mal\\] and \\[sec:c13rep\\]. We consider a co-infection study of FIV in cats . The experiment showed that disease in cats caused by infection with a virulent feline immunodeficiency viruses (FIV$_f$) can be attenuated by prior infection with strains of lower pathogenicity from cougars. The data are from twenty cats that were experimentally infected with two strains of FIV, the virulent house cat (Felix) strain (FIV$_f$) and a mild wild cougar (Puma) strain (FIV$_p$). On day 0, 10 cats were infected with FIV$_p$ and 10 were sham inoculated. On day 28 five cats from each group were inoculated with FIV$_f$ and the other ten cats were again sham inoculated. This resulted in four treatment groups: C (control, only sham inoculation), P (FIV$_p$ on day 0 and sham on day 28), F (sham on day 0, FIV$_f$ on day 28) and D (dual infection, FIV$_p$ on day 0 and FIV$_f$ on day 28). A variety of cytokines and cell counts that were thought to relate to protective immunity were measures approximately every 7 days. Details of the experiment can be found in .\n",

The goal of the experiment was to elucidate what immunological conditions best distinguished sever from attenuated infections. The `ade4`-package has refined statistical and graphical methods to explore multivariate patterns. According to the ‘French protocol’ , as implemented in the `ade4`-package, biplot-like decompositions are referred to as ‘duality-diagrams’ (because of the arrows and points); Thus the naming of `dudi.pca` for principal component analysis. We use the `dudi.pca` function to elaborate on the biplot. By providing an explicit ‘group’ annotation we can add group means as well as group ellipses (which reflect within-group variability) to the biplot using the `s.class` function. The `add.scatter.eig` function adds the eigenvalue histogram to the bottom right corner that shows the relative importance of each PCA axis(fig. \\[fig:pca31\\])."
