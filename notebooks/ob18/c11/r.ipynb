    "\n",
    "Pathogens move in space because of movement of transmission stages and infected/susceptible hosts. Spatial pattern arise from landscape heterogeneities, dispersal and ‘reaction-diffusion’ dynamics among spatially dispersed susceptible and infected individuals. The probability distribution that governs dispersal distances is often referred to as the dispersal kernel. A variety of functional forms have been proposed in the ecological and epidemiological literature . From the point of view of basic theory, it is often assumed that dispersal takes an exponential (the probability of dispersing a distance $d \\propto \\mbox{exp}(-d/a)$, where a is the range) or Gaussian ($\\propto \\mbox{exp}(-(d/a)^2)$) shape. The exponential model arise, for example, if we assume dispersal happens in a constant direction with a constant stopping rate. The Gaussian model arise if the stopping rate is constant but movement direction changes randomly like a Brownian motion. However, other kernels are relevant; calculated the movement probabilities of infectious larvae of a gut nematode of sheep, *Trichostrongylus retortaeformis*, that performs a random walk until it encounter a leaf of grass. Assuming the location of the leaves are according to a spatially random point process, they showed that the random walk leads to a dispersal distance distributions that follows a Bessel $K_0$-function. used this kernel in a model of pollinator-vectored plant pathogens. Empirical dispersal distribution of free-living organisms typically has an over-representation of rare long-range jumps that are improbable according to these kernels; They are so-called ‘fat-tailed’ kernels , which have important consequences for the speed of spatial spread .\n",
    "\n",
    "For human infections spatially-contiguous, diffusive kernels are often a poor fit to empirical patterns because spread often follows a characteristic ‘hierarchical’ fashion ; Infections usually appear in big cities early, thereafter the timing of epidemics on average happens in an order of descending size and increasing isolation. This chapter is focused on inferring the shape of the spread-kernel from spatial patterns over time; and then investigate the dynamical consequences of such spread. We start with considering the simpler diffusive kernels and then consider the more complicated patterns arising from human mobility.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Filipendula* rust\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Jeremy Burdon and Lars Ericson surveyed presence/absence of a fungal pathogen on a wild plant, *Filipendula ulmaria*, across islands in a Swedish archipelago . The `filipendula` data contains observations for 1994 (\\$y94) and 1995 (\\$y95), with spatial coordinates \\$X and \\$Y. There are additionally a large number of descriptive covariates for each site. used the data to estimate the most likely dispersal kernel of the rust. The host plant is an herbaceous perennial with pathogen spores overwintering on dead tissue. The infections in 1995 thus arose from the spores produced in 1994.\n",
    "\n",
    "If spores disperse according to, say, an exponential function with range, $a$, then the spatial force of infection on any location, $i$, will be $\\propto \\sum_j z_j \\mbox{exp}(-d_{ij}/a)$, where, $z_j$ is the disease status (0/1) in the previous year and $d_{ij}$ are the distances to other locations. The idea is that each spring, every local group of hosts will be in the accumulated spore shadow of last years infected individuals. This leads to a metapopulation ‘incidence-function’ model for the presence/absence of rust among all locations from year to year. Figure \\[fig:filip\\] shows the spatial layout and disease status of the hosts."

    " discuss how we may understand the emergent complicated spatiotemporal dynamics of models of natural enemies in terms of the spatial variance (or associated autocorrelation) and covariance of the interacting species[4]. proposed to calculate auto- and cross-correlation functions from simulated or real data. We can use the `Sncf`-function in the `ncf`-package to calculate the ‘multivariate’ spatial correlation function among the simulated time-series (see chapter \\[chap:c12\\] for further details on this and other geostatistical methods). We can further look at the spatial *cross-correlation* function between susceptibles and infected (fig. \\[fig:ncf\\]). The background synchrony for both compartments (of around 0.3) is due to the common seasonal forcing. The locally higher autocorrelation at shorter distances is due to emergence of dispersal-induced aggregations of infected individuals. The negative local cross-correlation is due to the local S-I cycles."

The peak in correlation is offset from the origin by somewhere between 5 and 10 units.
