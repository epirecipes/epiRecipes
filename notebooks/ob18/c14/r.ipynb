    "Many of the classic studies of the spatio-temporal dynamics of natural enemies and their hosts consider parasitoid-host interactions. Parasitoids represents a fascinating group of insect ‘infections’. Adults are free-living and lay their eggs in larvae (or eggs) of host insects. Hosts die when the parasitoid(s) complete their development and adults emerge from the infected hosts. From a dynamical systems point of view parasitoid-host interactions share many features of infectious disease dynamics. It is therefore instructive to cap our discussion of spatiotemporal dynamics with a discussion of this ecological interaction.\n",

    "Parasitoids has been used for bio-control of agricultural pest through the ages . Successful bio-control require that the natural enemy – in this case parasitoid – keeps the pest consistently below an economic threshold. The inherent instability predicted by the Nicholson-Bailey model is at odds with successful biocontrol by parasitoids. Many different model modifications have been analyzed to see when stable regulation can happen. These include: (i) long-lived adult hosts, (ii) density-dependent host growth, (iii) heterogeneity in risk such as aggregated attack rates, spatial heterogeneity, host refugia and (iv) interference among parasitoids . showed – by replacing the Poisson-attack assumption with a negative binomial distribution – how heterogeneity in risk stabilizes dynamics.
