## Macroparasite model from May and Anderson (1978)

This section implements model F described in equations (19) - (21) from [May and Anderson (1978)](https://doi.org/10.2307/3934). This is a basic model of macroparasite-host interaction based on the assumption that the number of parasites per host follows a Negative-Binomial distribution with aggregation parameter k.
